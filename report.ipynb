    "The all-pairs shortest path problem is the determination of the shortest graph distances between every pair of vertices in a given graph. The canonical way of solving this problem is by computing all pairs shortest paths (APSP) using the Floyd–Warshall algorithm, which runs in $O(n^3)$ where n is the number of vertices in the given graph. But in case of planar graph, we can exploit the fact that the graph is not dense and present **_Snowball_** algorithm which gives better running time complexity for the planar graphs."

Let $π : i = v_0 → v_1 → · · · → v_{l−1} → v_l = k$ be a shortest path from i to k, and let $h_{max} = max\\{h |v_h ∈ π\\}$. By DPC, if $h_{max} > k$, there exists a path of the same weight where a shortcut $v_{h_{max} −1} → v_{h_{max} +1}$ is taken.<br/>\n",
    "This argument can be repeated to conclude that there must exist a shortest path $π'$ from i to k that lies completely in $G_k$ and, except for the last arc, in $G_{k−1}$. Thus, by the induction hypothesis and the observation that the algorithm considers all arcs from the subgraph $G_{k−1}$ to k, $D[i][k]$ is set to the correct value. An analogous argument holds for $D[k][i]$. \n",
    "With regard to the algorithm’s time complexity, note that the two outermost loops together result in each of the $m_c$ edges in the chordal graph being visited exactly once. The inner loop always has fewer than n iterations, yielding a run time of $O (nm_c )$ time. From the observation above that $m_c \\le nw_d$ , we can also state a looser time bound of $O (n^2 w_d)$.<br/>\n",
