# APS_Project

## How to run the code

**Running from Jupyter Notebook**

1.	Navigate to the directory where all files are present
2.	Open Jupyter Notebook by typing command 'jupyter notebook' in terminal from that directory
3.	Open APS-Project.ipynb file and run all the cells
	
**Running directly from terminal**
1.	Run file driver.py to run directly from the terminal


### Note:

1.	This code is written in python version 2.7, and it has some issues regarding package installation in python version 3.*
2.	Number of nodes to compute for can be changed in the code
3. 	We have dataset for planar graph with 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 20000, 50000, 200000 vertices
4.	Time taken for vertices 5000 and above are huge and should be avoided for quick implementation check.
